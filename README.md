# odin-recipes

Here is my first web project with Odin Recipes.

3 Recipes has been added into the web page. All 3 of them having the same structure:
- A headline with recipes name
- An image of representation of the recipe
- A short description
- Ingredients
- And lastly the steps

I used links, images, lists, headings and paragraphs in this simple HTML project.
I also created all the directories and files with Git and committed while making changes.
